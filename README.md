# Just-Another-Dialogue-Editor

'Just Another Dialogue Editor' or 'JADE' is a open-source custom dialogue creation tool using Godot 4.0+, but can be used for any dialogue system that uses JSON deserialization. It works by allowing for the creation or loading of 'Conversations' that contain many different smaller sections of the conversations, with the reading order being decided by both the nodes ID and the nodes its connected to, and then taking this 'Conversation' and serializing it into a JSON file for it to be parsed by a dialogue reader. This project includes a simple dialogue reader built in so that you can test your conversations dynamically. I plan to update this whenever I need additional features for my own projects, but since its open-source, feel free to edit it for your own use :).
